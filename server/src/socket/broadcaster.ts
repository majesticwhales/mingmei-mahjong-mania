/**
 * `Broadcaster` implementation that fans realtime updates out over a
 * Socket.IO `Server`. Replaces the no-op default in `process-command`
 * and `scheduler/run-tick` once chunks 4+ wire it in via the registry.
 *
 * Three responsibilities (TDD §6):
 *   - `emitEvent` — append-style log entries broadcast verbatim to
 *     every socket in `game:{gameId}`. Wire shape matches
 *     `game.state.recentEvents[]` so clients can extend their local
 *     history without massaging the payload.
 *   - `emitNotification` — opaque `{ template, data? }` template
 *     instances broadcast to the game room. The template catalog
 *     itself is a rule-layer concern.
 *   - `emitState` — fan out a *team-scoped* `game.state` projection.
 *     We pin a single `now` so every team's projection sees the same
 *     wall clock (matters when a slot unlock boundary lies inside the
 *     fan-out window), group connected sockets by joined team, build
 *     one projection per team, and emit it to each member socket of
 *     that team. Sockets that joined the game room without a team
 *     (e.g. mid-handshake, or a spectator path we haven't built) are
 *     silently skipped — they're not a valid v1 state.
